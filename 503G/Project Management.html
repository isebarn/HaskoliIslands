<div class="notesContainer">
<p>Project management delivers tools to organizations that need to improve their </p>
<p>	planning, implementation and management of the activities they need to </p>
<p>	complete</p>
<p></p>
<p>Project management was onece a "special need" management.</p>
<p>However, more recently they have become the standard way of doing business</p>
<p></p>
<p>There are simple reasons why project management has become as important as</p>
<p>	it is</p>
<p></p>
<p>	1. Compression of the product life cycle</p>
<p>			As the driving force of competition has exploded, especially in the tech</p>
<p>				industrym companies must develop products and produce them in </p>
<p>				a exponentially faster time frame. 30 years ago, a product could have</p>
<p>				a 15 year lifecycle. In today's world, the average life cycle is 1-3 years</p>
<p>			With that in mind, it is obvious that indtroducing a product to the market</p>
<p>				as soon as possible greatly increases its time present on the market</p>
<p></p>
<p>	2. Knowledge explosion</p>
<p>			Things all around us are rapidly becoming more complex. 30 years ago</p>
<p>				laying a road was as simple as calculating necessary raw materials, hiring </p>
<p>				people and laying the road. Today, immense calculations and planning </p>
<p>				are required that complicate things greatly, but also provide a better, longer</p>
<p>				lasting road.</p>
<p>			If "simple" things like laying a road have become more complex, it is easy to</p>
<p>				reason that complex things like cellphones, automobiles, televisions etc are</p>
<p>				monumentaly more complex than 30 years ago</p>
<p></p>
<p>	3. Triple bottom line (planet, people, profit)</p>
<p>			In recent years, and especially in recent years, enviromental factors have risen</p>
<p>				enormously in importance. A company cannot simply do anything to maximize its</p>
<p>				profits at the expense of the atmosphere, ocean, land or living things</p>
<p></p>
<p>	4. Corporate downsizing</p>
<p>			Restructuring of the typical organization has had a huge effect on middle management</p>
<p>				Middle management has effectively been replaced by project management, as middle</p>
<p>				management by its design is not remotely as efficient as a dedicated project manager</p>
<p></p>
<p>	5. Increased customer focus</p>
<p>			As competition in every market has increased, customer satisfaction has become a</p>
<p>				leading priority. Customers want customized products and it is the project managers</p>
<p>				responsibility that the projects is steered in the direction the customer wants</p>

<span class="s1">A project is a temporary endeavour to create a unique product/service/result</span>
</p>
<p>
<span class="s1"></span>
</p>
<p>A project is different from a program in the sence that a program is a group of related projects</p>
<p>	designed to accomplish a common goal</p>
<p></p>
<p>A project also has "two dimesions" that need to be intertwined. Sucessfully implementing a project</p>
<p>	is not simply about gathering people that have the tecnical know-how to complete the project, but</p>
<p>	there is a sociocultural side aswell</p>
<p></p>
<p>	The sociocultural side refers to skills regarding leadership, problem solving, teamwork abilities,</p>
<p>		negotations, politics and satisfying customer expectations</p>
<p>	Meanwhile, the technological side that everyone is more of less familiar with, dels with the</p>
<p>		scope of the project, schedules, allocating resources, tracking costs and status reports and </p>
<p>		breaking the project down into executable work packages</p>
<p></p>
<p>Projects are integrated through the portfolio management. The portfolio management</p>
<p>	-Oversees project selection</p>
<p>	-Monitors resource levels and skills</p>
<p>	-Encourages use of best practices</p>
<p>	-Balances projects in the portfolio to represent a risk level that is ideal for the organization</p>
<p>	-Improves communication among all stakeholders</p>
<p>	-Creates a total organization perspective</p>
<p>	-Improves the management of projects</p>

<p>The goal of a project is to satisfy a customers need. Projects have specific characteristics</p>
<p>	
</p>
<p>	1. An defined objective.</p>
<p>			Unlike in an typical organization, workers do repeated tasks every day</p>
<p>	
</p>
<p>	2. A defined life span with a begining and an end</p>
<p>			Becouse of the defined objective, there will be a defined endpoint</p>

</p>
<p>	3. The involvement of several departments </p>
<p>			Many organizations are  sectioned into departments that arent necessarily in the same</p>
<p>				building. In a project, multiple agents from many departments may be assigned</p>
<p>				on the same project </p>

<p>	4. Doing something that hasnt already been done</p>
<p>			A project usually wont have routine tasks or even tasks that have been done anywhere</p>

<p>The goal of portfolio management is to ensure that projects are aligned with the strategic</p>

<p>	This is important, as there are usually much more projects available than there are</p>
<p>		resources available to the organization</p>

<p>Objects are classified in three categories</p>

</h3>
<div class="notesContainer">
<p>The simplest way to organizing a project, is to simply manage it using the existing hiearchy </p>
<p>	in the organization. Coordination is maintained with the usual management channel</p>
<p></p>
<p>The advantages of the functional organization  as a means to manage a project are:</p>
<p>	1. No change to the organizational structure, as it is used to manage the project</p>
<p>	2. Flexibility in staff, as employees are easily assigned to isolated tasks and then returned</p>
<p>	3. In-depth expertise for projects that have a narrow scope</p>
<p>	4. Easy post project transition when project completes</p>
<p></p>
<p>Its drawbacks are less appealing</p>
<p>	1. Lack of focus. This is due to the fact that employees arent considered a part of a project</p>
<p>			and they might be brought in for a single task. This results in them not commiting</p>
<p>			to the task at hand</p>
<p>	2. Poor integration. There is a chance of poor integration across functional unit groups, as</p>
<p>			each group feels their project is the most crucial one and give little concern for other</p>
<p>			parts of the total project</p>
<p>	3. Slow. It generally takes longer for functional groups to complete projects. This is due to</p>
<p>			slow response time, as information needs to circulate through normal management</p>
<p>	4. Lack of ownership. The project may be seen as an additional burden on employees that are</p>
<p>			assigned to some additional tasks</p>

<p>
<span class="s1">Dedicated team is an organizational structure where all of the resources necessary for the project</span>
</p>
<p>
<span class="s1">	are assigned full time</span>
</p>
<p></p>
<p>Dedicated teams operate as separate units from the rest of the organization. A full time manager</p>
<p>	is assigned and his first job is to pick a team from specialist who will also be full time on the</p>
<p>	project, both from within and outside the organization</p>
<p>The parent organization has various ways to keep a leash on the team, usually a financial constrain</p>
<p>Other firms are built to support projects, where most work within the organization is accomplished</p>
<p>	with dedicated teams. These organizations are known as "Projectized Organizations"</p>
<p></p>
<p>The benefits of the dedicated team structure are:</p>
<p>	1. Simple. As human resources are taken from a pool an assigned full time, team members</p>
<p>			wont need to be scheduled time with the team and with the rest of the functional </p>
<p>			organization</p>
<p>	2. Fast. These projects usually get done quickly as team members are both dedicated to the</p>
<p>			project and thus focused, and additionally cherry picked from a pool, so they are </p>
<p>			expected to be more or less qualified for their tasks.</p>
<p>		In addition, information runs quickly accross the team every time a decision needs</p>
<p>			to be made, guaranteeing that it gets made quickly</p>
<p>	3. Cohesiveness. As everyone is dedicated to the projects, cohesion forms amongst team</p>
<p>			members and they strive to do the best job they can</p>
<p>	4. Cross-functional integration. As each member is picked especially for a job, not only can</p>
<p>			specialists accomplish some task faster, but better</p>
<p></p>
<p>There are some concerns on these teams. Although these do not affect the project itself but rather </p>
<p>	the organization, they need to be addressed regardless</p>
<p>	1. Expensive. These projects are way more expensive as personell are assigned full time but</p>
<p>			might not be doing actual work full time. This is due to the fact that person A might be</p>
<p>			waiting for person B to complete task X, so that he can begin work on task Y. In the meantime</p>
<p>			he does not go to the parent organization to assist on other tasks, he does nothing of value</p>
<p>	2. Internal strife. The team may feel like they are an autonomous entity. Not a huge problem</p>
<p>			but a problem nonetheless as it undermines the parent organization to have a team that</p>
<p>			has begun to regard itself as "better than the rest of the company"</p>
<p>	3. Limited technological expertise. Even though team members are chosen with expertise in</p>
<p>			mind when the team is formed, in some areas their expertise may be limited</p>
<p>	4. Difficult post-project transition. When the project completes, the team members may find it</p>
<p>			difficult to re-integrate into the parent organization</p>

<img src="Project Management_files/images/Matrix arrangement.jpg"></div>
<div class="notesContainer">
<p>The matrix arrangement has a project management structure "laid" onto the normal functional</p>
<p>	hierarchy and includes "two" chains of command. The functional command and the project</p>
<p>	command, both of which project participants report to</p>
<p>The matrix structure is designed to optimize resources by having individuals working on </p>
<p>	multiple projects as well as performing on normal, functional duties</p>
<p></p>
<p>There are 3 types of matrices</p>
<p>	1. Weak matrix. This is similar to the functional approach, except a project manager</p>
<p>			is assigned to coordinating project activities.</p>
<p>			Functional managers are responsible for their segment of a project and "call the shots"</p>
<p>			Project managers are responsible for creating schedules, collecting info and project status</p>
<p>		
</p>
<p>			A weak matrix is suited for projects where technical quality  is necessary</p>
<p></p>
<p>	2. Balanced matrix. Here, the project manager is responsible in defining what needs to be</p>
<p>			done and defining it, while the functional manager is concerned in how it will be accomplished</p>
<p>		The project manager creates a plan, sets schedules and monitors progress</p>
<p>		The functinoal manager assigns personell and executes their segment of the project</p>
<p></p>
<p>		A balanced matrix balances project requirements with technical requirements</p>
<p></p>
<p>	3. Strong matrix. This structure creates the illusion of a project team within the matrix enviroment</p>
<p>			The project manager controls most aspects of the project. Who does what, what will be done.</p>
<p>			The functional manager has title over his people and is somewhat regarded as a subcontractor</p>
<p></p>
<p>			A strong matrix works best where project integration is important as it improves control</p>
<p>				over project activities and costs</p>
<p></p>
<p>The benefits of a matrix organization are</p>
<p>	1. Efficiency. Resources may be shared accross projects as well as within functional divisions</p>
<p>	2. Strong project focus, as there is a formal project manager responsible for coordinating</p>
<p>	3. Easy post-project transition, as individuals are tied up in two or more projects, completing</p>
<p>			a project does not require them to integrate themselves into project halfway complete</p>
<p>	4. Flexible. Resources are shared more flexibly so expertise across the firm can be utilized better</p>
<p></p>
<p>There are some weaknesses though</p>
<p>	1. Dysfunctional conflict. Tension between project and functional managers can have a </p>
<p>			huge negative effect</p>
<p>	2. Infighting. When resources are being shared across projects, some infighting can occur </p>
<p>			between teams</p>
<p>	3. Stressful. Every team member has two supervisors</p>
<p>	4. Slow</p>

</h3>
<div class="notesContainer">
<p>Estimates are considered to be good if they are 95% accurate</p>
<p></p>
<p>Factors that influence the quality of estimates are</p>
<p>	1. Planning horizon. </p>
<p>			Meaning time. Estimates made for tomorrow will be fairly accurate while</p>
<p>				estimates for 3 months from now may not be accurate at all</p>
<p>	2. Project duration. </p>
<p>			Related to the planning horizon. The longer a project is, more uncertainty is </p>
<p>				introduced in the planning horizon</p>
<p>	3. People</p>
<p>			People tend to pad their estimates to ensure they are on time. They are also sometimes</p>
<p>				asked to estimate another person which will obviously introduce erros</p>
<p>	4. Project structure and organization.</p>
<p>			One of the advantages of a dedicated project team, is that there is confidence in the</p>
<p>				estimates in the team, as everyone knows exactly what needs to be done, and they</p>
<p>				have all the time they need</p>
<p>			This quality is not inherited in matrix structure</p>
<p>	5. Padding estimates</p>
<p>			Employees estimating their own work arent the only ones that pad estimates, project</p>
<p>				managers also pad the combined estimates from the team. In addition, they pad the</p>
<p>				cost estimates so they prove to be under budget when the project completes</p>
<p>	6. Organizational culture</p>
<p>			Some organizations accept padding of estimates, which in turn encourages the padding</p>
<p>				of project managers and individual workers. Other organizations do not and might </p>
<p>				strongly discourage it</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>The ones responsible for work, i.e persons at the work package level, should do their own </p>
<p>	estimates as they are most familiar with it.</p>
<p>	Using several people if possible as a consensus of many experts will improve estimates even</p>
<p>		further</p>
<p>Estimates should also be produced considering normal conditions, not optimal or worst case</p>
<p>	scenarios, but using what seems to be the average on a normal day</p>
<p>Time units should be created that are universal over the project. A single time unit might be 3 days as </p>
<p>	it may not make sence to use single days as a measuring device as it is to precise</p>
<p>Lastly, estimates should not assume that contingency plans are in place </p>

</h3>
<div class="overview">
<img src="Project Management_files/images/Cost estimates.jpg"></div>
<div class="notesContainer">
<p>There are a few ways to make cost estimations, depending if estimating is made top-down</p>
<p>	or bottom up</p>
<p></p>
<p>Top-down methods</p>
<p>	1. Consensus method</p>
<p>			Estimates made by top managers that pool together their experience on past </p>
<p>				projects that feel similar</p>
<p>	2. Ratio methods</p>
<p>			Related to the consensus method, but more scientific. Similar projects are </p>
<p>				weighed by similarity and cost, and a concrete number calculated. Fx if </p>
<p>				a past project was laying 100m of pipe, and the project under discussion is</p>
<p>				laying 500 meters of pipe, the cost will be slightly less than 5-times that of the</p>
<p>				former project</p>
<p>	3. Apportion methods</p>
<p>			An extention of the ratio method. If a project is close enough to a past project, that</p>
<p>				projects data is used</p>
<p></p>
<p>	4. Learning curves</p>
<p>			When a project is composed of doing the same thing many times, there will be a learning </p>
<p>				curve. Each time the quantity doubles, unit hours are reduced at a constant rate</p>
<p>			Managers realise this and see that if a project will be building 50 identical houses, the first</p>
<p>				3 houses will be slow, houses 4-6 half as quick and so forth</p>
<p></p>
<p>Bottom-up methods</p>
<p>	1. Template methods</p>
<p>			If a project is similar to a project someone has already done, they can expect that individual</p>
<p>				to be able to complete the new task in at least the same ammount of time</p>
<p>	2. Parametric procedures applied to specific tasks</p>
<p>			Like the ratio method</p>
<p>	3. Range estimating</p>
<p>			If a project has high uncertainty, there will be given a range, low, medium and high</p>

<p>	Time constrained projects: Resource smoothing</p>
<p>		When projects are time constrained, the best strategy is maximizing resource utilizating</p>
<p>			to make sure all resources are as productive as possible. This is called resource smoothing</p>
<p>		
</p>
<p>		If there are three tasks, A, B and C, needing 1,2 and 1 resource respectively, and we have</p>
<p>			2 resources, we want to work on A and C in parallel and then work on B, instead of first</p>
<p>			working on A, then B, then C</p>
<p></p>
<p>		To level resources we take our project network and observe which activities have slack and </p>
<p>			those activities may be pushed back. If fx task A,B and C take 1,2 and 1 weeks respectively and</p>
<p>			project D is dependant on the completion of all of them, we work 2 weeks on B and then 1 week</p>
<p>			on A and C, or vice versla</p>
<p></p>
<p>	There is a drawback to leveling, as it eats up our slack and indtroduces the risk of a new critical </p>
<p>		path, and when a critical path is delayed, the whole project is delayed, which ironically is exactly</p>
<p>		what we're trying to prevent when leveling</p>
<p></p>
<p>	Resource leveling accomplishes both reducing the peak demand for resources, shortens the</p>
<p>		requirement for resources over the span of the project, in addition to minimize fluctuations</p>
<p>		in resource demand.</p>
<p>		Minimizing fluctuations has more benefit on some projects, if a resource is in one place and </p>
<p>			needs to be moved, that takes time, how much time is dependant on the resource, if 						</p>
<p>			its a programmer, he can easily drive to a new place, but if its a a chemical silo containing</p>
<p>			ammonia, that will be a quick project all by itself to move</p>

<div class="notesContainer">
<p>When resources arent adequate to meet peak demant requirements, there is a resouce problem</p>
<p></p>
<p>The project network is a good tool to remedy this constraint. There exists a method called the</p>
<p>	parallel method that delays activities by choosing the best one to delay</p>
<p>	If there are 3 tasks, A,B and C that should all run in paralell, but cant becouse of resource</p>
<p>		constraints, we delay one of them or more according to the following pecking order</p>
<p>		1. Minimum slack</p>
<p>		2. Smallest duration</p>
<p>		3. Identification number</p>
<p></p>
<p>	Meaning if A,B and C have slack 2, but B slack of 0, we delay either A or C.</p>
<p>	If then A takes 1 week to complete but C takes 2 weeks, we delay A</p>
<p>	If A and C would both take 1 week to complete, we would delay either one, usually simply</p>

<p>To minimize these effects and build a foundation for a team identity, the project manager can</p>

<h3 class="topic">
<a name="66tabguc9iv2ne0jhbi7h6o5b9">&nbsp;&nbsp;Pros and Cons</a>
</h3>
<div class="notesContainer">
<p>The reasons to outsource are numerous</p>
<p></p>
<p>	1. Cost reduction</p>
<p>			When a task or tasks can be outsourced offshore to countries like China or Ingia, cost</p>
<p>				will drop significantly, and as a bonus, overhead costs will drop aswell</p>
<p>	2. Faster project completion</p>
<p>			If outsourcing is a viable option, i.e more cheaply, it means that the project may</p>
<p>				be completed earlier than expected, as a work package or packages arent</p>
<p>				the organizations concern untill they are complete</p>
<p>	3. High level of expertise</p>
<p>			If a task needs huge technological knowhow, and the organization isnt staffed for</p>
<p>				such a task, outsourcing to a qualified contractor results in higher quality in less time</p>
<p>	4. Flexibility</p>
<p>			Outsourcing makes an organization less dependant on their own resources</p>
<p></p>
<p>The drawbacks are just as many</p>
<p></p>
<p>	1. Coordination breakdowns</p>
<p>			There is a specific challenge in managing project over different organizations. Needless</p>
<p>				to say if a task in outsourced to China or India or another foreign country, there can</p>
<p>				be language barriers, cultural differences etc</p>
<p>	2. Loss of control</p>
<p>			If many tasks are outsourced to many different contractors, all a part of the same project</p>
<p>				there will be huge difficulties if just a signle one fails to deliver</p>
<p>	3. Conflict</p>
<p>			Projects are prone to conflicts if the participants do not belong to the same organization</p>
<p>	4. Security issues</p>
<p>			Depending on the nature of the project, trade or business secrets may be revealed</p>

<a name="0fe4si76ofpqbedb52pn5e0ppl">&nbsp;&nbsp;Best practices</a>
</h3>
<div class="notesContainer">
<p>Best practices are:</p>
<p>	-Well defined requirements and procedures</p>
<p>		Hiring a contractor requires one to define with huge accuracy what it is that they are</p>
<p>			supposed to deliver to you. In addition, your firm and the other must have management in </p>
<p>			sync to work together</p>
<p></p>
<p>	-Extensive training and team building activities</p>
<p>			Managers must also train personell effectively to work with people from other organizations</p>
<p>			These people need to be "friends"</p>
<p>			Team building sessions may be implemented in a organised way</p>
<p></p>
<p>	-Well established confloct management</p>
<p>			Conflict is more or less inevitable. Escalation is the primary control mechanism to deal with</p>
<p>				problems</p>
<p>			The rule of thumb, is that if a conflict has not been resolved by the individuals involved within</p>
<p>				24 hours, management should interviene and make sure that the conflict comes to an </p>
<p>				agreement</p>
<p></p>
<p>	-Frequent review and status updates</p>
<p>			Reviewing progress to keep track on wheter your partner is keeping up his end is important</p>
<p>			Even though he is responsible to you, you are ultimately responsible to your customer</p>
<p></p>
<p>	-Co location</p>
<p>			Working together instead of apart makes a huge difference. Companies usually rent, if possible</p>
<p>				some accomodation for a task/project so that the organizational team and the contractors</p>
<p>				team can work together</p>
<p></p>
<p>	-Fair contracts</p>
<p>			It may seem obvious that a project manager should try to snare the best (cheapest) price</p>
<p>				for a contract. This is in no way true</p>
<p>			Acheiving a one time price may be beneficial, however that may make you an unappealing</p>
<p>				partner for the subcontractor, and word does spread</p>
<p>			Reaching a fair deal where everyone wins is incalculably more beneficial, as you may want</p>
<p>				the contractors services later, and then he must be willing to work for you</p>
<p>			It makes better morale and more sense</p>
<p></p>
<p>	-Long term outsourcing releationship</p>
<p>			If a fair contract is negotiated with some contractor, and he does a good job, you will surely</p>
<p>				want his services again.</p>
<p>			Hiring the same contractor creates a great bond that goes a long way in cooperation</p>
<p>			This has economical benefits aswell. Reduced administrative costs as there is some cost</p>
<p>				involved with meeting contractors and considering offers.</p>
<p>			It also unilizes resources better as contractors can give you estimates of the work</p>
<p>				so you wont have to</p>
<p>			As you get familar with a contractor, communication becomes easier.</p>
<p>			Performance will also be enhanced as your partner will begin to learn what it is exactly what</p>
<p>				you expect from him</p>

<p>	1. Separate people from the problem</p>

<p>				run a negotiation.</p>
<p>	2. Focus on interests, not positions</p>
<p>			If you need something for 50$, but the contractor says it will cost 100$, do not hold on</p>
<p>				to your pride.</p>
<p>			Negotiate what is the fair ammount. Make the project his project so this isnt just a pot </p>
<p>				of gold for him</p>
<p>	3. Invent options for mutual gain</p>
<p>			If the contractor feels like he is a part of the project and he has something to gain, negotiating</p>
<p>				will go smoother</p>
<p>	4. Use objective criteria</p>
<p>	5. Dealing with unreasonable people</p>
<p>			BATNA (best alternative to a negotiated agreement)</p>
<p>			If the person you have to negotiate with is unreasonable, you just walk away untill that person</p>
<p>				understands that you are looking for a win/win scenario and nothing less</p>
