Hver eru SCRUM hlutverkin og lýstu ábyrgð hvers og eins

	SCRUM  is a specific agile methodology, like RUP, RPD and Lean
	SCRUM begins with a high-level scope definition and a ballbark time/cost estimates close
		enough to be comfortable with deciding on the project

	Scrum uses product features as deliverables, a piece of a product that delivers useful functionality to a customoer

	Scrum relies on specific roles, meetings and documents to manage a project

	The roles are:
		Product owner
			The person acts on behalf of customers to represent their interests.
			They are responsible for ensuring that the development team focuses their
			efforts on developing a product that fulfill the business objective of 
			the project
			The product owner is the one that makes changes in features and priorities
			at the end of each sprint. 
		The development team
			The team is responsible for delivering the product. The team is made up of
			a few people with cross-functional skills. There are no designated roles or 
			titles, people take on responsibilities depending on the nature of the work
			and the team is self organizing
		The Scrum master
			The master facilitates the Scrum process and resolves impediments at the team
			and at the organizational level. He isnt a leader of the team as the team is 
			supposed to lead it self, rather a buffer between the team and outside
			interference. A coach not a manager

	The Scrum meetings are:
		Sprint planning
			At the start of each sprint, the product owner and the development team
			negotiate what product backlog items  the team will attempt this sprint
			The owner identifies the features he values most 
			Once goals have been chosen and meeting adjourned, they cannot be changed 
		Daily scrum
			The core of an agile project is the daily meeting, called the scrum
			Every day at the same time at the same place, a team discusses what has 
			been accomplished since the last daily scrum, what will be done before the
			next one and what problems are present
			This meeting is short, 15 minutes, at a whiteboard
			This meeting creates a sense of team identity and encourages openness
			The scrum master manages the whiteboard but does not assign tasks
		Sprint review
			At the end of a sprint, the team demonstrates the actual work product
			increments they have built to the product owner
			Feedback is welcomned from the owner  and he declares what he feels is
			complete and what needs more work
			The team may present some suggestions for refinements 
		Sprint retrospective
			This meeting is facilitated by the scrum master, and its purpose is to
			reflect how well the previous sprint was executed. Discuss what can be
			improved and decide on changes on how things will be done next sprint

	Documents:
		Product backlog:
			The product backlog is the customers prioritized list of features desired
			and is kept by the product owner
		Sprint backlog:
			The backlog is the developing teams log on what features to assign time to
			and how much time
