1. Why are accurate estimates critical to effective project management?
	They support good decisions, schedule work, cost and time. They help deciding wheter
		a project should be accepted or not
	During a project, estimates also help clairifying where a project should be at time, 
		quality and budget wise

2. How does the culture of an organization influence the quality of estimates?
	
	Some organizations may fx allow padding or at least tolerate it as a human factor
		that cannot be circumvented
		Other organizations might even encourage padding, while others may even
			look strongly against it and prohibit it

3. What are the differences between bottom-up and top-down estimating
	approaches? Under what conditions would you prefer one over the other?

	If a project has a loosely defined scope or if a project is small enough for 
		top managers to accurately estimate it, they do. Consequently, projects that 
		have huge uncertainty are handled by top managers
	When projects have a fixed price or a tight schedule they must be estimated by the people
		that will execute the plan. In addition, if customers want to be involved in decisions 
		estimates are made on the work package level


4. What are the major types of costs? Which costs are controllable by the project
	manager?

	General and administrative
	Overhead
	Direct costs

	Project manager can control to some degree the direct cost by negotiating contracts, materials,
		salary etc
