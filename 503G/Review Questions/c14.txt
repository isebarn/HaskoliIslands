1. How does the project closure review differ from the performance measurement
	control system discussed in Chapter 13?

	Performance measurement is an ongoing activity to keep track. The review is more
		of a final one, and more thorough

2. What major information would you expect to find in a project review?

	A summary, reiews, analysis, reccomaendations, lessons learned and an appendix


3. Why is it difficult to perform a truly independent, objective review?

	Becouse everyone is at least a tiny bit, biased

4. Comment on the following statement: “We cannot afford to terminate the proj-
	ect now. We have already spent more than 50 percent of the project budget.”

	If the expected return from the project is less than the other 50% that we need to
		spend to finish, we wont finish it

5. Why should you separate performance reviews from pay reviews? How do you
	do this?

	The pay review is usually outside the juristiction of the project manager

6. Advocates of retrospective methodology claim there are distinguishing charac-
	teristics that increase its value over past lessons learned methods. What are
	they? How does each characteristic enhance project closure and review?
