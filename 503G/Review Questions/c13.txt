1. How does a Tracking Gantt chart help communicate project progress?
	If depicts where we should be versus where we are with a project

2. How does earned value give a clearer picture of project schedule and cost status
	than a simple plan versus actual system?

	It shows how much of the budget we have used to complete how much of the project

3. Schedule variance (SV) is in dollars and does not directly represent time. Why
	is it still useful?

	It shows us if we are under or over budget with a task

4. How would a project manager use the CPI?

	It shows hof efficiently money is being spent

5. What are the differences between BAC and EAC?

	BAC is the total budget at hand, and EAC is an estimation of what we will be needing
		in total to complete the project

6. Why is it important for project managers to resist changes to the project
	baseline? Under what conditions would a project manager make changes to
	a baseline? When would a project manager not allow changes to a baseline?

	Scope changes, and by extention baseline changes, should only be accepted if either
		the project will clearly fail without changes or if there is significant improvement
		promise with these changes.
		Additionally, if the customer is ready to pay for changes, they may be allowed

	Otherwise, changes in scope will be expensive and of no direct benefit to the project
