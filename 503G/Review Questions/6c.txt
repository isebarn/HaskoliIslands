1. How does the WBS differ from the project network?
	
	Both the WBS and the Project network visually describe the work packages required
	In addition, the WBS shows all branches, what work packages belong to what part of the project
	What the WBS does not show, but the Project Network does show, is duration of tasks and the
		dependancies of work packages. The project network allows us to view the sequence
		work packages need to be executed in, how long they will take, and what effect delays will
		bring
	The Project network does not in general show the branches of work packages

2. How are WBS and project networks linked?
	
	The work packages from the WBS are the (only) ingredients for a Project Network

3. Why bother creating a WBS? Why not go straight to a project network and for-
get the WBS?

	The Project Network doesnt describe what project parts the work packages belong to.

4. Why is slack important to the project manager?
	
	It tells him how much a project can be delayed without delaying the overall project

5. What is the difference between free slack and total slack?
	
	Total slack tells us how much a task can be delayed without delaying the whole project
	Free slack tells us how much a project can be delayed without affecting its successor

6. Why are lags used in developing project networks?

	Lag is the ammount of time a project "must" be delayed to begin or end. Fx if building
		a whole house is a single activity (it isnt, but its an example) and the windows must
		be custom made in Italy and shipped. The whole house may be ready in 1 week, but the 
		glass windows wont arrive until they have been ordered
		If building the house is work package A and ordering windows is work package B, then A
			is lagged by a week, becouse its end is somehow dependant on another completing
	

7. What is a hammock activity, and when is it used?
	A series of activities that span a considerable segment of the whole project
