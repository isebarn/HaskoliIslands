1. Project risks can/cannot be eliminated if the project is carefully planned.
	Explain.

	There can always something occur that wasnt forseen. Additionally, not all risk
		is eliminated, it may be reduced in terms of likelyhood or probability, transferred
		or simply accepted

2. The chances of risk events occurring and their respective costs increasing
	change over the project life cycle. What is the significance of this phenomenon
	to a project manager?

	A project manager should be monitoring all risk events

3. What is the difference between avoiding a risk and accepting a risk?

	Avoiding a risk entails fx reducing its likelyhood or simply changing the plan

	Management reserves are to cover huge risks

6. How are the work breakdown structure and change control connected?

	Change control affects the work breakdown structure, as if a change occurs, the scope changes

7. What are the likely outcomes if a change control process is not used? Why?
	
	The changes wont go through properly
	If nobody is assigned to implement the changes, they wont be made
	If info regarding the changes arent communicated, relevant stakeholders wont be aware of the 	changes
	If the budget is not adjusted, there will be a discrepancy in the budget that might have
		a negative effect

8. What are the major differences between managing negative risks versus positive
	risks (opportunities)?
