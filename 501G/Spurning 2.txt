Explain the difference between sequential, iterative-incremental, agile and plan-
	driven process models.

	The sequential model, is an extreme version of the waterfall model and it:
		-Identifies all requirements at the begining of a project
		-Creates a thorough design as a blueprint before programming starts
		-Defines a complete schedule at the beginning of the project

		It assumes that requirements are static, implementation details can be
			predicted completely, time estimates are accurate etc

		This methology is unrealistic

	The iterative incremental model splits a projects into iterations, where
		each iteration is a mini project, making requirements more fathomable,
		and slowly building a software by first creating a small software with
		minimal functionality, and then adding to that functionality with each 
		iteration.
		Every iteration is a chance to change, remove or add more requirements as
		the desired functionality becomes clearer by each iteration

		Benefits of this system are:
			-Better productivity
			-Lower defect rates
			-Early visible progress
			-Early user engagement and feedback
			-Manageable complexity

	Plan-driven process models use iterations and are subschemas of the interative
		incremental.
		In a plan-driven development we:
			-Gain insight using models and specifications
			-Manage risk by planning
			-Strive to structure the project early
			-Optimize by planning
			-Work on the most risky features first
			-Every increment is a section of the working system
			-Roles and responsibilities have clear outlines
			-A somewhat well defined end product
			-Plans are to be followed

	Agile driven process models also use iterations and thus, are subschemas of the
		iterative incremental mode.
		In an agile enviroment we
			-Paint a picture by communicating and by receiving a ton of feedback
			-Manage all risk by being flexible
			-Not firmly structured
			-Optimize by refactoring until desired quality has been acheived
			-Features deemed most valueable developed first
			-Every increment yields a product
			-Flexible target vision
			-Teams organize themselves
			-Freedom
