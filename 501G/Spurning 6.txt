Explain how the goals of the Inception and Elaboration phase in the 
	Unified Process differ.

	Inception is to envision the product scope, vision and business case, while the
		elaboration phase is meant to build the core architecture, resolve risk elements
		discovered in the inception phase, define most requirements that make up the
		scope from inception and estimate the overall schedule and resources

	The business case from Inception includes the success criteria, risk and estimation
		of resources. These are somewhat refined in the Elaboration phase and the risk
		is dealt with

	Moving from inception to elaboration can be thought of as moving from an educated guess
		to a engineering/feasibility study
