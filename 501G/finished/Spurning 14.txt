Explain how quality requirements can influence the design and implementation
	of a system, and why they may require trade-offs.

	Quality requirements obviously shape the design in the inception and elaboration phase
		and the implementation in the construction phase aswell
	The architectural analysis is largely concerned with the quality attributes, namely identifying
		them with the aim of bringing focus to those that are of most value
	Architectural analysis yields a factor table that details all the quality requirements dressed
		up as scenarios, sorted by difficulty and priority for success
		The architect can then, more or less, make trade-offs having a clear view of priorities
			and interdependancies
