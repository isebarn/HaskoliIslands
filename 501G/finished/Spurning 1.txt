Explain how software can be both a product and a vehicle that delivers a
	product, and argue what that means for its creation process.

Software is a product built and supported by developers, using an agile process aimed at
	creating a product people will want
	
	Software as a product is some behaviour that when deconstructed is a calculator, as
	software takes information and uses that info to produce new information, display it, modify it etc.

	Software is also a vehicle that delivers a product. Software controlls the computer that
	in turn runs more software, communicating the information passed by software to other
	software, controlling software and ofcourse, creating more software

	As software is logical but not a physical thing (but secretly it is, but not in the sence we're interested in), it has characteristics that physical things dont have.
	Software is developed but not manufactured

	Creating software, is therefore, always the same task, as all software does the same
	thing, but with different functionality and complexity. Every software boots, finds
	the information it needs, transforms that information as needed, and then applies the
	transformed information to acheive the result its described to do

	So creating software will always be the same category of tasks that need to be specified
	differently each time

	This process is usually the unified process I suppose.
