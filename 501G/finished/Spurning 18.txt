Explain the different meanings of arrows in UML sequence diagrams in a
	domain model vs. in a design model.

	In a domain model there are messages from actors to systems and responses back
	Messages from actors to the system are represented by solid, closed arrows with a solid 
		line and labeled with some pseudo method 
	Responses from the system to an actor are drawn with dotted lines and an open arrow

	In the design model there are more arrows. Arrows from actors to the system that are messages
		just like in the domain model, filled arrowheads with solid lines
	Also like the domain model, the return messages are dotted lines with open arrowheads
	However there are additionally, solid lines with open headed arrowheads that represent the
		creation of a lifeline
	There is another type of arrows that represent the duration constraint but there is some
		discrepancy in which these are written

In domain models:
Arrows are labeled with actions or messages, most intuitively from the actor’s perspective (from the arrow’s source).
Interactions are most often asynchronous, and actors don’t expect an immediate response before proceeding.
.
In design models:
Arrows are labeled with names of methods being called (methods defined at the arrow’s destination).
Method calls are typically synchronous and an actor is waiting for a response before proceeding with something else.
