Explain the difference between internal and external quality attributes, and give
	two examples of each.

	External and Internal

	External qualities are those users perceive when using the software, like performance and
		efficiency, reliability, ease of use etc. All these qualities make up the groups "overall
			functionality" and "relayability" and "usability"
		These can be measured using a few experts or testers

	Internal quality are qualities that developers would find by looking at the code itself
	Cohesion, where objects/classes are responsible for a single thing and do that thing efficiently
	Low coupling, meaning that there are, preferably but unrealistically, no interdependencies 
		between objects
	Clairity





















Internal quality attributes: Efficiency, Modifiability, Portability, Reusability, Scalability, Verifiability
External quality attributes: Availability, Installability, Integrity, Interoperability, Performance, Reliability, Robustness, Safety, Security, Usability
