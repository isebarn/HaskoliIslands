Discuss if user interface descriptions should be part of a use case.

	No they shouldnt, they mainly introduce three things that simply speaking, contradict the 
		reason we want use cases when figuring out requirements

		1. They introduce some ambiguity, fx "User click create the new account button" instead
			of "User creates a new account"

		2. Makes use cases more complex. Related to reason 1, writing "user creates a new account"
			is more simple than "user clicks the create new account button and is redirected to ..."

		3. Use cases are supposed to be solution independent, i.e "what" but not "how"

	In short, use cases are supposed to cover functional requirements
