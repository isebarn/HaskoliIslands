Explain how the phases of the Unified Process differ from the phases of the
	waterfall model

	The waterfall model consists of:
		-Figuring out the requirements
		-Designing the system
		-Implementing the design (building)
		-Testing
		-Deloying
		-Maintaining

	The phases of the UP modell are 
		-Inception
		-Elaboration
		-Construction
		-Transition

	The difference:
		The waterfall model tries to esablish firmly what will be done. All the requirements
			and the risks, designing and building.
			The waterfall model moves to the next phase when it is completed and perfect, and there is no going back

		The UP model, rather than iteratively creating modules or building blocks of a software
			that will be then laid down once ready, the UP creates a working system with minimal functionality and iteratively adds features and polishes existing 
			features until the system is ready

	The two have a much in common on the surface but not in practice. They both do a 
		requirement alanysis, but the Waterfall model does a more thorough one and 
		does it just once, while the UP does a "ballparck" analysis, mostly to check
		viability and to map the logistics, rather than to have a clear picture of how
		the final product should function. Further analysis is performed iteratively
		by feedback and so forth, slowly painting the whole picture as the software is 
		produced

	In its essence, the waterfall model makes plans and sticks with them and delivers 
		a product
	In its essence, the UP creates a product with a neglible ammount of functionality
		and quantatively refines it, adding functionality as it evolves into a full product
