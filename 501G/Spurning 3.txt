Discuss how Eisenhower’s statement “I have always found that plans 
	are useless, but planning is indispensable” could be interpreted in 
	the context of software engineering.

	The activity of "planning" enables the developing team to define the overall
		goals. Doing that is not the same thing as writing up a physical plan
	Planning decides the management and technical practices that enables the 
		team todefine a road map to follow

	Planning with the customer helps decide the scope. Meeting  again and again
		creates an interated plan, adjusting priorities, risks, quality etc

	In conclusion, written down plans are rarely followed, it is the planning process
		itself that helps everyone on the team to move in sync towards a goal

	As an example I could think of a software factory with a foreman, who decides
		in his own head what needs to be done and how, an gives out instructions and
		expects his final product within the time frame he has calculated

	In contrast, there is a 5 person team that discusses how things should be done
		to reach an engoal. This team meets weekly or bi-weekly and rethinks  up
		a plan
