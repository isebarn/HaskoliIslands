Explain how a risk-value matrix helps to prioritize risks.
	A risk matrix is a x-y grid showing impact on the y-axis and probability on the x-axis
	The grid could be sectioned into 5x5 parts, where 1 means little and 5 means alot
	So a risk that is sectioned in the 5x5 position is high probability and high impact

	All risk factors may be evaluated neatly using this grid and the result is a list
		of risk events that can be prioritized by their position on the grid
	Top priorities would obviously be the ones that score 5x5
	High priority those who score 3x5,4x5,4x4,5x4 and 5x3 
	Medium and low follow
