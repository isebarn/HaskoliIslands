Explain the difference between a decision node and a fork node in a UML
	activity diagram

	A decision node splits a flow into two or more available flows to indicate a decision
		to follow path A or path B etc
	A fork node is similar but not really. A fork node does split a flow but into concurrently
		running flows, i.e things that are done in parallel
