Explain the relationship of phases and activities in the Unified Process.

 In the UP development is organized into a series of short mini-projects called iterations. Iterations
	are done over different phases

The UP organizes the project work and iterations into four phases
1. Inception - Approximate vision, business case, scope and make ballpark estimates
2. Elaboration - Refine the vision and iteratively implement the core architecture, resolute
	high risk scenarios, identify most requirements and scope and further refine estimates
3. Construction - Iterative implementation of the remaining lower risk and easier elements
4. Transition - Beta testing and deployment

These phases are then further broken down into iterations, f.x the Elaboration phase might have 3 iterations while
	the construction phase could have 8 phases, and the transition phase only 2. The inception phase typically 
	consists of a single iteration

An activity of a specific worker is a unit of work that an individual in that role may be asked to perform

An activity has a clear purpose, usually expressed in terms of creating or updating some artifacts like a 
	model, plan, class etc
	Every activity is assigned to a specific worker and is thought to take a few hours or a few days
